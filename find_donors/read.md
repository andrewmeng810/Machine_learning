Using individuals' data collected from 1994 U.S. Census, we are going to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 
The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_.
